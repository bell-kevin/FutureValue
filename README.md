# futureValue
This is similar to the previous project, Become a Millionaire, where the bank has an account where the user deposits an amount of money, and selects the interest rate for its growth, but for this project, the user then declares how much time (how many cycles cycles) the account will remain untouched, locked up, unavailable to the user. So you know the starting value, the growth rate, and the length of time, but not the ending value of the account after that time. This program will ask the user for the starting investment, the interest rate, and the length of time to grow the account, then calculate how much money that account will have in it after that time has passed, the future value of that starting investment.


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
