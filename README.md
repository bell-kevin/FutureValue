# FutureValue
This is similar to the previous project, Become a Millionaire, where the bank has an account where the user deposits an amount of money, and selects the interest rate for its growth, but for this project, the user then declares how much time (how many cycles cycles) the account will remain untouched, locked up, unavailable to the user. So you know the starting value, the growth rate, and the length of time, but not the ending value of the account after that time. This program will ask the user for the starting investment, the interest rate, and the length of time to grow the account, then calculate how much money that account will have in it after that time has passed, the future value of that starting investment.
